## Building

Starting with changeset 3633 version 3.2, WordPress for iOS uses Cocoapods (http://cocoapods.org/) to manage third party libraries.  Trying to build the project by itself (WordPress.xcproj) after launching will result in an error, as the resources managed by cocoapods are not included.  

1. Obtain CocoaPods if required (link above)
2. To build the pods, navigate to the root directory of WordPress-iOS and run `pod install`. 
3. Launch the workspace by either double clicking on WordPress.xcworkspace file, or launch Xcode and choose File > Open and browse to WordPress.xcworkspace.
